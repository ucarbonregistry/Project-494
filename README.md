# Project-494
10 MW Biomass based Power Project by Sanjog Sugars &amp; Eco-Power Private Limited (Prior CDM Reg ID: 5723) 

The project activity of setting up a 10 MW biomass based power generation project in Rajasthan is
promoted by Sanjog Sugars & Eco-Power Private Limited (SSEPPL). SSEPPL was incorporated on
December 17, 2004 under the Companies Act. SSEPPL is engaged in the business of inter alia,
purchasing, manufacturing and dealing in sugar products. SSEPPL is also engaged in generation of
electricity or other energy and conventional and non-conventional energy sources on a commercial basis.

The project activity involves setting up a 10 MW biomass based power generation at Sangaria,
Hanumangarh District of Rajasthan, India, which will generate electricity and supply to the regional
(Northern, Eastern, Western, North Eastern - NEWNE) electricity grid. The project activity consists of
installation of one 47 TPH boiler with outlet parameters of 4750 C temperature and 66 kg/cm2  (atm)
pressure and one bleed cum condensing turbine of capacity 11.5 MW (normal output) with a rated output
of 10 MW. The biomass which will be used for power generation in the project activity mainly includes
cotton stalks and mustard husk available in the region. 

Other seasonally available renewable biomass residues in small quantities might be utilised in force majeure conditions like change in cropping pattern. 

The purpose of the project activity is to utilize the surplus biomass available in the region for generation
of electricity and supply to the regional (NEWNE) grid to meet the ever-increasing demand for energy in
the region and country. Thus the project activity results in the reduction of GHG emissions associated
with generation of equivalent amount of power in the fossil fuel dominant regional (NEWNE) electricity
grid. The electricity generated from the project activity will be around 61,670 MWh and the project
activity would potentially reduce around 51,803 tCO2e annually.

The proposed project activity consists of installation of one 47 TPH boiler with a rated output of 10 MW Turbine for power generation. The project was registered under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM ID -5723) for the crediting period from 13 Feb 2012 to 12 Feb 2022. However, no carbon credits (CERs) were issued during this period.

Seeking issuance under UCR since no prior issuance history under CDM.
___________
ISSUANCE CONDITIONS UCR: 
Issuance starts from 01/01/2013 and not prior.

Since the PP has already registered under the CDM and has reported to the CDM an emission factor of 0.84 tCO2/MWh for the period 2012-2020 (link: https://cdm.unfccc.int/UserManagement/FileStorage/R68WD71BK4QM3YC5LNXZHIJ0UOSAGP) permitted to use the same for the calculation for the credits in the said period (most conservative estimate UCR principle).

In the 2021-2023 vintage, to use the 0.9 tCO2/MWh UCR grid emission factor for the same.

In the 2024 vintage, to use revised UCR emission factor of  0.757 tCO2/MWh as updated by UCR (link to update: https://medium.com/@UniversalCarbonRegistry/ucr-cou-standard-update-2024-vintage-ucr-indian-grid-emission-factor-announced-ddb790cdc603).
